Inheritance:
- Build relationships between objects - grouping together similar concepts
- reduce code duplication.
- In python - use parentheses in the class declaration to have the class inherit from another class
- Allows to use objects as attributes and access their attributes and methods
- Example:
    class Fruit:
       def __init__(self, color, flavor):
            self.color = color
            self.flavor = flavor

    class Apple(Fruit):
        pass

    class Grape(Fruit):
        pass

    granny_smith = Apple("green", "tart")
    carnelian = Grape("purple", "sweet")
    print(granny_smith.flavor)
    tart
    print(carnelian.color)
    purple

- allows us to define attributes or methods that are shared by all types of fruits - prevents individual creation
- define parent class - have n child classes inherit from parent class
- child classes will have attributes from parent as well as own attributes


Object Composition:
- situation where two classes are related but there is no inheritance
- one class makes use of code contained in another class
- Example: (Twp classes)
    - Package class - attributes about the software package, like name, version, and size
    - Repository class - all the packages available for installation
    - No inheritance but relationship exists
    - Repository class - will contain dictionary/list of packages

    class Repository:
     def __init__(self):
         self.packages = {}
     def add_package(self, package):
         self.packages[package.name] = package
     def total_size(self):
         result = 0
         for package in self.packages.values():
             result += package.size
         return result

    - constructor method - initializes package dictionary
    - add_package method - takes package object as parameter and adds it to dictionary, using package name as key
    - total_size method - computes total size of all packages in repository
    - we're using package attributes in our repository class & we're also calling values() method in packages instances

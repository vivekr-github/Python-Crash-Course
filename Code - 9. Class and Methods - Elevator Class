The code below defines an Elevator class. 
The elevator has a current floor, it also has a top and a bottom floor 
that are the minimum and maximum floors it can go to. 

class Elevator:
    def __init__(self, bottom, top, current):
        """Initializes the Elevator instance."""
        self.bottom = bottom
        self.top = top
        self.current = current
        pass
    def up(self):
        """Makes the elevator go up one floor."""
        if self.current == self.top:
            return "Cannot got up. At top floor"
        else:
            self.current+=1
    def down(self):
        """Makes the elevator go down one floor."""
        if self.current == self.bottom:
            return "Cannot got down. At bottom floor"
        else:
            self.current-=1
    def go_to(self, floor):
        """Makes the elevator go to the specific floor."""
        if floor <= self.top and floor >= self.bottom:
            self.current = floor
        else:
            return "Invalid floor"
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Current floor: {self.current}"

elevator = Elevator(-1, 10, 0)

elevator.up() 
elevator.current #should output 1

elevator.down() 
elevator.current #should output 0

elevator.go_to(10) 
elevator.current #should output 10


# Go to the top floor. Try to go up, it should stay. Then go down.
elevator.go_to(10)
elevator.up()
elevator.down()
print(elevator.current) # should be 9
# Go to the bottom floor. Try to go down, it should stay. Then go up.
elevator.go_to(-1)
elevator.down()
elevator.down()
elevator.up()
elevator.up()
print(elevator.current) # should be 1


elevator.go_to(5)
print(elevator)
#prints 'Current floor: 5'

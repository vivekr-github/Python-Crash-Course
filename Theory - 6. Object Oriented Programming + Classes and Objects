Object Oriented Programming:
- concepts modeled as classes and objects
- idea - defined using class
- object - instance of class
- almost everything in python - object
    strings, lists, dictionaries, numbers
    when we create a list in python, we're creating object of list class
- classes have
    - attributes - characteristics of class
    - methods - functions part of class
- type() gives what class a variable belongs to
- dir(object) - lists all attributes and methods of an object
- help(object) - return the documentation for the corresponding class


Defining Classes & Objects:
Class
- start with class keyword followed by name and a colon.
- recommendation - start name with capital letter
Object
- create instance of class by assigning it to variable
- set or access attributes, call methods using dot notation

- syntax:
    class class_name:
        attribute1 = ""
        attribute2 = ""

    object1 = class_name()
    object1.attribute1 = value1
    object1.attribute2 = value2

    object2 = class_name()
    object2.attribute1 = value3
    object2.attribute2 = value4
